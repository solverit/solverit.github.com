*<q>"Hello, World!"</q>*

As this is the first blog post on this website.

This website is created using the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static website
generator. You define the layout of your pages using regular HTML (combined with
Hugo's [templates](https://gohugo.io/templates/overview/)), CSS and JavaScript
and you write your pages' contents using Markdown. Hugo takes these source files
and generates the HTML files for you. All you have to do afterwards is deploy
these files on your server.
